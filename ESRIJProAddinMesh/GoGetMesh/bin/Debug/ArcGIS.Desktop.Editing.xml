            This was added as part of a workaround to bring the vertices grid back to the split pane.
            Currently, whenever split calls RefreshMessages(), it will trigger a HotSelectOperationEvent.
            When this is handled by the HotSelectViewModel, RefreshGeometry() will be called. 
            Since split generates these events so often, this property was added to prevent unnecessary 
            geometry refreshes. Original issue: /editing/issues/1012

            <summary>
            this is a map-switching hack to allow EditFeatures to prevent tool de/activation within Initialize and Shutdown.
            Another way to do this would be to add a bool param to those methods, but those methods are used a *lot*,
            so this approach is simpler - time will tell if it works ok....

            this interface may optionally be implemented by an <see cref="T:ArcGIS.Desktop.Framework.Controls.EmbeddableControl"/> that is declared in DAML as belonging to the

            <remarks>
            An EmbeddableControl that implements IEditingCreateToolControl can be used for displaying
            Tool options within the Active Template pane as well as within the Template Properties Tools tab,<br/><br/>
            If the corresponding View must show differing information in the pane or tab, this can be handled
            by setting appropriate properties within <see cref="M:ArcGIS.Desktop.Editing.IEditingCreateToolControl.InitializeForActiveTemplate(ArcGIS.Desktop.Editing.ToolOptions)">InitializeForActiveTemplate</see>
            and <see cref="M:ArcGIS.Desktop.Editing.IEditingCreateToolControl.InitializeForTemplateProperties(ArcGIS.Desktop.Editing.ToolOptions)">InitializeForTemplateProperties</see> methods. <br/><br/>
            It's also possible to reuse the same EmbeddableControl and associated View for multiple Tools,
            which might be useful if several Tools have identical or very similar options.
            Each time the Initialize methods are called, 
            the specified <see cref="T:ArcGIS.Desktop.Editing.ToolOptions"/> provides the current Tool ID as well as current Template, allowing the 
            implementation to set appropriate properties.<br/><br/>

            Provides a portal into the Elevation Surface native code.
            
            Queries for elevation are not awaitable because we want them to run within the Global Utility ThreadPool
            and not block any of the Dispatcher or CIM threads unnecessarily.   The calling/thread pattern is typically like
            this:
                  UI  -->  managed(QuerySurfaceMapPoint)  -->  Dispatcher  -->  native(CIM)  -->  native(Global TP)  --> native(CIM)  -->  managed(QueryService/Sync)  -->  QueryCache callback
            
            The CIM really only gets involved when Geometrys are de/serialized
            
            Note: this class is public so that it can be used by other assemblies, e.g. ArcGISAnalyst3D,
            but isn't intended to be exposed to the SDK.

            Base class to handle toolbar settings. Settings are saved when an error source is deactivated (toolbar is hidden) and restored when an error source is reactivated (ie the toolbar reappears)
            This base class handles two basic settings - IsMapExtentFilterOn, IsExceptionsFilterOn.  The expectation is that your toolbar (if your error source requires one) will display controls 
            allowing the user access to modifiy these settings.  Each toolbar has a single settings instance and it should be created in the constructor of your toolbar.
